Implementation of ternary search tree

## Overview of project assignment
- Working in Github
    - Use commit messages
    - Use branches
    - Provide an environment file
- Implementation of ternary search tree
    - Proper documentation of code necessary
- Testing of implementation
    - Tests are provided in notebook
    - Additional testing may be added
- Analyze complexity and perform benchmark tests
    - For all the operations: string insert, string search, prefix search, all_strings,â€¦
    - Argue complexity of functions
        - Also discussion possible about worst cases and how this compares to average cases
    - Then, verify this experimentally
        - Benchmarking: test scaling behaviour of the implementation
        - Generation of larger dataset (+- 500.000) is required for benchmarking: provide code or source
